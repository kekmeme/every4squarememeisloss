# Every 4 Square Meme is Loss
generate loss memes => post them to FB page => ??? => Profit



## Development Phases:
- [ ] Phase 1: Make a bot the can upload an image we provide it to FB page in a periodic basis 
- [ ] Phase 2: upgrade the bot to generate random 4 square image (any 4 square image is loss, therefore, first randomly loss meme bot ever)
- [ ] Phase 3: add image processing in order to actually have a meme that fits the scheme of a loss meme
- [ ] Phase 4: add automatic reply to the page based on the bot's capabilities

be aware that phases 3 and 4 can happen simultanously
